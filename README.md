# Canvas Grade Calculator

## Overview
This is a simple utility to calculate your grade on Canvas by copy-pasting your "Assignments" page.

After submitting the copy-pasted text, all assignments will be displayed. At this point, you are able to add and edit any assignments you wish. Category weights can also be edited on the right hand side.

This tool also allows you to calculate the amount of points needed to maintain a certain grade. Just specify the total amount of points the assignment is worth, the target grade, and the assignment category, and click "Calculate". You will be shown the number of points you would need to get, along with the corresponding percentage.
